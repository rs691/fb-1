/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict security model that segregates public and private data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The rules are designed around a clear separation of concerns. Top-level collections like
 * `products`, `projects`, and `events` are treated as public, world-readable content.
 * All user-specific data, such as profiles and shopping carts, is nested under a
 * `/users/{userId}` path, enforcing a strict user-ownership model where only the
 * authenticated user can access their own information.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains private user profile data.
 * - /users/{userId}/carts/{cartId}: Contains user-specific shopping cart data.
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product information.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Publicly readable portfolio project information.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Publicly readable event information.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Data: `products`, `projects`, and `events` are readable by anyone, including
 *   unauthenticated users, to support the website's public-facing content. Writes to
 *   these collections are currently disabled pending the implementation of an admin role system.
 * - Private Data: All data under `/users/{userId}` is strictly private. A user can only
 *   read or write documents within their own data tree.
 * - No User Listing: To protect user privacy, it is not possible to list all documents
 *   in the top-level `users` collection.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, a user's profile document must contain an `id` field
 *   that matches their authentication UID. This field is immutable to prevent re-association.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset primarily relies on path-based authorization (e.g., checking `{userId}` in
 * the path against `request.auth.uid`), which is highly performant and avoids costly `get()`
 * calls for authorization checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The security model is built on structural segregation. Private user data (`carts`) is
 * placed in a subcollection under the user's document, while public data (`products`)
 * exists in separate top-level collections. This makes security rules simpler and queries
 * more efficient.
